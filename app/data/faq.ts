    question: "Why choose Profusion over a traditional agency?",
    answer: "Direct access to ex-HSBC, UBS, and Aviva design and technical leads—no juniors, no account managers, no bureaucracy. You get enterprise-grade solutions at 30-40% lower cost, delivered at startup speed. Think bank-level quality without the bloated agency pricing and endless meetings."
  },
  {
    question: "Where are you based?",

When projects demand it, we seamlessly embed with your team on-site, bringing our enterprise expertise right to your office. It's the best of both worlds: global talent pool, local presence."
  },
  {
    question: "How does your fixed pricing work?",
    answer: "We've eliminated the uncertainty of hourly billing. After a thorough scoping session, you get a fixed price that won't change unless you change the requirements. Pay only when you're satisfied, with flexible payment plans available. Our enterprise background means we estimate accurately and deliver predictably."

    question: "How quickly can you deliver?",

You get bank-level security, scalable architecture, and risk management—without the enterprise complexity or cost. It's about future-proofing your business from day one."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you maintain quality at such speed?",

  },
  {
    question: "What kind of support do you provide?",

  {
    question: "How do you ensure project success?",
    answer: "Success is systematic for us. We combine enterprise-grade project management with startup agility. Clear milestones, daily communications, and regular demos ensure you're always in control. Plus, our fixed pricing model means our incentives are aligned with your success—we only win when you win."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if we need changes after launch?",
    answer: "Business evolves, and so should your technology. That's why we build flexibility into every solution and include a 30-day support period. Need changes later? Our clean, modular code makes updates straightforward. Choose between our maintenance packages or let us train your team—whatever works best for your business."
